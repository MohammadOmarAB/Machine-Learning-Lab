Problem statement:
This project aims to build a machine learning regression model that predicts the price of a car 
based on its features such as brand, model year, engine specifications, fuel type, transmission, and mileage. 
By learning patterns from historical car data, the model can estimate car prices accurately, 
which can assist buyers, sellers, and automotive analysts in decision-making.
